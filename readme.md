# Welcome to EEG Familiarity Prediction Repository

This research project is mainly concerned with:

1. Replicate result from this previous paper to build necessary toolset to perform additional research https://pages.ucsd.edu/~desa/EEG_Reveals_Familiarity_2021.pdf
	- [Simulation of Accuracy Based on the Reported Value](https://github.com/FleischerResearchLab/EEG-Familiarity-Prediction/blob/3b08c1a5dd28305b15cd60372e5f43449fdabbb4/AccuracySimulation-Analysis.ipynb)
2. Apply new dataset from this paper to corrobate the findings in the first paper.
